1)created sorting_page.dart(to give input and select sort )
2)created sorting_animation_page.dart(to show the sorting process visually)
3)created algorithm_descriptions.dart(to show explanation of step by step swapping)
4)created sorting_codes.dart(to show code for that selected sort)


To run this code 
1) Replace your lib folder with this one inside your flutter application.
2) Also update pubspec.yaml if needed.(Check commit messages for this).
3) Also check the assets folder if it is not present then place this in root directory of your flutter application.
4) Now run your application in android studio by connection any virtual device.


pubspec.yaml updated 
splash_screen.dart and home_page.dart pages are cerated
code changed in main.dart


pubspec.yaml updated(once you replace them, run flutter pub get to install new dependencies). 
New comparison_page.dart has created for graph comparisons.
main.dart has been updated(replace them with the old one).
algorithm_sorting.dart has been updated(replace them with the old one).
sorting_page.dart,sorting_animation_page.dart have been updated for graph comparisons(replace them with the older ones).


Added titlecard.mov video for loading screen namecard animation.
pubspec.yaml updated(added dependencies for titlecard.mov video).
splash_screen.dart code has been updated Replaced old text with video for loading screen).


Added loading.mov for animation between screens.
New UI changes for sorting.
Fixed slow loading of comparison screen.


1)created searching_page.dart(to make user to find the searching of a number with linear search,binary search,hashing)
2)created searching_animation_page.dart(to show the visual searching steps)
3)created searching_algorithm_descriptions.dart(to show the step by step explanation of that particular search technique)


Added all codes for graph algorithms.
4 graph algorithms added prim's, kruskal's, dijkstra, bellmanford.
To run this just place the graph folder inside your lib also changed home_page.dart for graph algorithms navigation.


enhanced sorting animation with code and description
grouped sorting algorithms into one folder
import changes in main.dart and home.dart


Added a new page for searching that contains the programming codes along with its time complexity
Modified the overall UI design for searching
Integrated timeline into animation page
Modified the comparison logics in graphs and it will display the final efficient algorithm among the selected ones for better understanding... 


Design
1)updated searching_algorithm_descriptions.dart
2)updated searching_code_page.dart


updated sorting_codes.dart for C, C++, Python

Design
1)updated sorting_page.dart
2)updated sorting_animation_page.dart
3)updated algorithm descriptions.dart with description and time complexity


A complete revamp has been done to graph algorithms
Icons added 
removed flutter logo loading 

updated sorting_page.dart to handle 0 and negative inputs.
updated sorting_animation_page to handle negative inputs.
updated searching_page.dart for the show dialog.


Added status message for kruskal and prims algorithm.
New titlecard.mov updated


updated sorting comparison_page.dart for correct working 
changes in sorting_page.dart

updated sorting_animation_page.dart to support upto 20 inputs
changes in sorting_page.dart

Updated dijkstra_page.dart code
Exception cases for input graph are handled.
Prims fixed but still not stable.
Update : Prims algorithm is now stable.
